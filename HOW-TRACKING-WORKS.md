## 🔄 The Complete Flow

### Step 1: You Create a Custom Link

You create different links for different places:

```
Instagram Story:    yoursite.com?source=instagram&from=story
Instagram Bio:      yoursite.com?source=instagram&from=bio
Twitter:            yoursite.com?source=twitter&from=tweet
TikTok:             yoursite.com?source=tiktok&from=video
```

### Step 2: You Share the Link

- Post it on Instagram story
- Add to your bio
- Tweet it
- Add to TikTok description
- Email it to your list

### Step 3: Someone Clicks Your Link

When they click, the URL parameters travel with them:
```
yoursite.com?source=instagram&from=story
              ↑                    ↑
           Platform            Location
```

### Step 4: They Submit a Question

The form captures:
- ✅ The URL parameters (source & from)
- ✅ Their browser info (Mobile Safari, Chrome, etc.)
- ✅ Device type (Mobile or Desktop)
- ✅ Referrer URL (where they came from)
- ✅ Timestamp

### Step 5: You See Everything in Dashboard

In your dashboard, you'll see:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Question: "What's your favorite food?"

📊 Source: instagram-story
⏰ Time: 5 minutes ago
📱 Device: Mobile
🌐 Referrer: instagram.com
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

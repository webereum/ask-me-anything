## ðŸ“‹ Step 1: Set Up the Database

You need to apply the database migration to create the necessary tables. Here are two ways to do it:

### Option A: Using Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
4. Click "New Query"
5. Open the file `supabase-migration.sql` in your project
6. Copy all the SQL code
7. Paste it into the SQL Editor
8. Click "Run" (or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)

You should see "Success. No rows returned" - this means your database is ready!

### Option B: Using the Migration Script (Alternative)

```bash
node scripts/apply-migration.js
```

Note: This might not work due to RPC limitations, so Option A is recommended.

## ðŸŽ¯ Step 2: How the Tracking Works

### Important: Privacy Notice

**You CANNOT automatically capture Instagram usernames or IDs.** This is protected by privacy laws and platform policies.

### What You CAN Track:

âœ… **URL Parameters** - You add these manually when sharing links
âœ… **Source Platform** - Which link was used (Instagram story, bio, Twitter, etc.)
âœ… **Device Info** - Mobile or desktop, browser type
âœ… **Referrer URL** - Which website they came from
âœ… **IP Address** - General location (for analytics only)
âœ… **Timestamp** - When the question was submitted

### Creating Trackable Links

When you share your link, add tracking parameters:

**For Instagram Story:**
```
https://your-site.com?source=instagram&from=story_oct20
```

**For Instagram Bio:**
```
https://your-site.com?source=instagram&from=bio_link
```

**For Twitter:**
```
https://your-site.com?source=twitter&from=pinned_tweet
```

**For Reddit:**
```
https://your-site.com?source=reddit&from=r_AMA
```

### How to Use This Information

When someone submits a question using the link above, you'll see in the dashboard:
- Source: `instagram-story_oct20`
- This tells you it came from your Instagram story posted on Oct 20

You can create different links for:
- Different posts
- Different platforms
- Different campaigns
- Different time periods

This way, you'll know which content drives the most engagement!

4. **Use Link Shorteners** - Makes links look cleaner and provides extra analytics
5. **Test Your Links** - Always test before sharing publicly

## ðŸ”’ Privacy & Ethics

### What's Tracked (Transparent):
- The link they used (you created it)
- Device and browser info (standard web analytics)
- Time of submission
- General location (from IP)

### What's NOT Tracked:
- Instagram username
- User identity
- Personal information
- Login details

### Be Transparent:
Your app already shows users: "Your question is completely anonymous. We only track the source link for analytics."

This is honest and ethical tracking!
